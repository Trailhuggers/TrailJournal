## Conflict Plan:

### What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
When our group encounters conflict, we will collaboratively give our individual input and agree to a mutual resolution. We will ensure that we are all safe to express our concerns when there is a conflict.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
If our group seems that a member isn’t adequately contributing, we as a group in a safe manner can inquire into the member’s workflow and see if they are struggling with anything.

### What is your process to resolve conflicts?
Our process to resolve conflicts would be to raise concerns to one another and as a group we will mutually decide on a solution.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
If our attempts to mutually agree on a solution are unsuccessful then we will ask the instructional team to mediate a conflict to help us come up with a solution.

## Communication Plan

* We will communicate in person when we are on campus and via Slack when we're off campus
* We will use a team Trello board to communicate tasks that need to be accomplished
* To ensure everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from everyone in the group are listened to, before we move forward on any decision we will do an intentional final "poll" of everyone to ask "Are you good with that or do you have any concerns?"
* We agree to be an open and honest team, and to respect each others ideas and opinions, while feeling psychologically safe to raise any concerns we have.
* We will have group meetings throughout the day to ensure we are on the right track with tasks, and communicate with what needs to be done, they will go as followed:

## Daily Team Meeting Schedule:

* 09:00 AM standup with instructional team
* 11:00 AM quick 5 minute team check-in
* 01:00 PM group standup to clarify afternoon plan
* 03:00 PM quick 5 minute team check-in
* 04:30 PM group standup to clarify what we are working on over the evening

## Git Workflow:

* We will have a Deployment repo and then fork that into a Staging repo.
* From the Staging repo will clone the Staging repo to their local machines.
* No coding will be done on our local masters. Whenever a team member goes to work on a feature, they will create a new branch under their local master to do so.  * They will then push their local branch to the Staging repo.
* They will then do a PR of their own branch to the Staging repo, but will NOT approve their own PR. When a team member initiates a PR, they will send a message to * Trevor in Slack to let him know.
* Trevor will be the one person who approves PRs to the Staging repo.
* For PRs to the Deployment repo, the group will approve these as a group.
* Trevor will approve/merge PRs every morning and then everyone will pull down from the Staging repo every morning after this merge.
