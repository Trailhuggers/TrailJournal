            <p>I've lived all over the pacific northwest, but have grown up in central Oregon most of my life. I've lived in Bend for about 16 years. I enjoy coding because it allows me to think creatively, solve problems, and build really cool things out of nothing!</p>

              <h2>Conor McCue</h2>
              <p>Conor is a Human Being, Oregonian, and Software Developer. His educational background is in the natural sciences and his most recent work experience was in forestry. He is excited by the internetâ€™s ability to advance human understanding and make previously esoteric data actionable.  Eventually he would like to use the adaptability, persistence, and creative problem-solving skills he developed as a wildland firefighter to reduce the cost of ecological data monitoring. Barring that, he just wants to make sweet graphs and solve other interesting problems.</p>
